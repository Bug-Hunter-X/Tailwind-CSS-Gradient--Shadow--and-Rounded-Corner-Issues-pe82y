```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold">Gradient Background</h2>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature, but it might produce unexpected results if the `from` and `to` colors are too different in brightness or hue.  This can lead to a jarring or visually unappealing gradient.

Another potential issue is incorrect usage of the `rounded-lg` utility.  If applied to an element with complex children, it may not round the entire element correctly.  Similarly, the `shadow-md` class could cast a shadow that doesn't visually complement the gradient.
